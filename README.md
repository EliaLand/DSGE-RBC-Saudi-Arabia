# DSGE-RBC estimation model in open economy applied to the Saudi-Arabian economy case

Welcome to the DSGE-RBC estimation model tailored for analyzing the Saudi Arabian economy within an open economy framework. This project focuses on implementing a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model augmented with Real Business Cycle (RBC) features to better understand the intricacies of Saudi Arabia's economic landscape.


## Overview:
The DSGE-RBC model presented here offers a comprehensive toolset to investigate various economic phenomena within the Saudi Arabian context. By integrating elements of both DSGE and RBC theories, we aim to capture the dynamics of the Saudi economy with a particular emphasis on its openness to international trade and finance.


## Key Features:
- **Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)**: This framework allows for analyzing the interplay of various macroeconomic factors over time, considering both endogenous and exogenous shocks.
- **Real Business Cycle (RBC)**: The RBC component enables us to model fluctuations in economic activity driven by productivity shocks, technological advancements, and other real factors.
- **Open Economy Dynamics**: Recognizing Saudi Arabia's integration into the global economy, our model accounts for trade flows, capital movements, and their impact on domestic economic variables.


## Specific Analytical Approaches:
- **Stochastic Analysis**: Our model incorporates stochastic elements to capture the uncertainty inherent in economic processes. We employ techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the probabilistic outcomes of different policy scenarios.
- **Data Cleaning**: Rigorous data cleaning procedures are applied to ensure the quality and reliability of input data. This involves identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in economic indicators specific to the Saudi Arabian context.
- **Stationarity and Seasonality**: Time series data used in our analysis are assessed for stationarity and seasonality characteristics. We employ statistical tests such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests to ascertain the presence of unit roots and seasonal patterns, respectively. Seasonal decomposition techniques such as seasonal adjustment or Fourier analysis are applied as necessary to remove seasonal effects from the data.


## Objectives:
- **Estimation**: We seek to estimate key parameters of the DSGE-RBC model using data specific to the Saudi Arabian economy, thereby enhancing our understanding of its structural characteristics.
- **Policy Analysis**: By simulating various policy scenarios, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of different fiscal, monetary, and trade policies in achieving desirable economic outcomes for Saudi Arabia.


## How to Use:
- **Data Preparation**: Ensure that relevant data on key economic indicators for Saudi Arabia are collected and formatted appropriately.
- **Model Specification**: Customize the model according to specific research questions or policy scenarios of interest.
- **Estimation and Analysis**: Utilize appropriate estimation techniques to calibrate the model parameters and conduct thorough analysis of simulation results.
